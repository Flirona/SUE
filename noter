SUMMARY
With technology growing at its current haste, we are wondering if it is possible for computers to create poetry as well as a person, 
and further.. if it is possible for a machine to tell the difference between poetry written by a human author and poetry generated by a 
computer?  We are interested in creating a program that categorizes a corpus of poems based on whether it is  composed by a person or by 
a computer. The program will not be concerned by the semantic content of the poem, but will instead focus on the poetic form such at it 
is i.e. patterns, repetitions of words or other physical aspects that might reveal the origin of the poem. The text corpus will consist 
of 50-100 different poems. The poems written by human authors will primarily consist of poetry from the 19th century, while the 
computer-generated poems will be contemporary as digital poetry often is a result of our current time. We are interested in including 
poetry by Poesimaskinen and Individ I fællesskab, two different projects that both create some type of autogenerated poetry.
It could also be interesting to run the program through texts that have been written by people, but are based on algorithms or certain 
patterns that might confuse the program in order to analyze if it is possible for man to fake the work of a computer, as it is for 
computers to fake the work of man.
